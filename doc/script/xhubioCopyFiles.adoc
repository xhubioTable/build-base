=== xhubioCopyFiles

This function copies static files into the build folder. To enable this functionality, add the following property to your `package.json` file:

[source,json]
----
{
  "copyFiles": [
    {
      "baseFolder": "src/graphql",
      "destFolder": "dest/graphql",
      "fileTypes": [".graphql", ".csv"], <1>
      "replace": {                        <2>
        "regExp": "(.*)spec\\.ts(.*)",
        "replacement": "$1.js$2"
      }
    },
    {
      "baseFolder": "src/csv",
      "destFolder": "dest/csv",
      "fileTypes": [".graphql", ".csv", ".json"]
    },
    {
      "baseFolder": "src",
      "destFolder": "dest",
      "fileGlobs": ["**/*.graphql"]      <3>
    }
  ]
}
----
<1> Files with the specified types in the source folder are selected.  
<2> Provide a `replace` object if you need to modify file names. This object uses `string.replaceAll(regExp, replacement)` to perform the replacement.  
<3> A glob pattern is allowed for recursive searches; the matched files are copied while preserving their relative paths.

To run the copy process, add the following script to your project:

----
npm run xhubioCopyFiles
